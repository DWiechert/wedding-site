					Megan Bomar <small>Matron of Honor</small>
				</h2>

				<p>Megan is the bride’s cousin, but is really like an older sister to Shanna. They both grew
					up together in Fremont, Nebraska and their mom’s are sisters. Megan lives in Omaha, Nebraska
					and Shanna tries to see her whenever she can. Megan can really make Shanna laugh, and she is
					looking forward to what she she comes up with for the speech at the wedding reception!</p>

				<h2>
					Colleen McLaughlin <small>Bridesmaid</small>
				</h2>

				<p>Colleen is one of Shanna’s best friends. They met each other during Shanna’s sophomore
					year of college in their sorority. Since graduation, Colleen has moved to Texas to pursue more
					schooling, but that doesn’t stop these two from talking everyday! Colleen and Shanna share a
					great love of Starbucks and some of the best memories of these two were their daily walks to
					Starbucks in college.</p>

				<h2>
					MaryHannah Shaw <small>Bridesmaid</small>
				</h2>

				<p>MaryHannah is another best friend of Shanna’s. These two became friends rather quickly -
					and often joke about how they don’t even know how it happened! They met through their sorority
					in college and created a lot of wonderful memories. MaryHannah lives in Omaha, Nebraska and
					talks to Shanna daily. These two try to see each other wheneve they can, and are proving that
					distance has no factor to their friendship!</p>

				</h2>

				<p>Natalie is the groom’s sister, but has become one of Shanna’s close friends and is like a
					sister to her. Natalie recently just graduated from college with a major in English education -
					something that her and Shanna have in common! Shanna loves going on shopping trips with Natalie
					and her mom when she’s in Chicago. Dan and Shanna also have great times with Natalie’s
					boyfriend Viktor; when these four get together, there are definitely a lot of laughs!</p>
