						Gifts <small>gift giving and registry</small>

					<p>
						<!--Wedding gifts are a tricky subject for us. We find ourselves caught between the excitement of filling a future apartment with all sorts of brand new things that just about any new couple would want and the desire to live below our means in a life of intentional simplicity. As we continue to have a strong sense of conviction for the latter, we ask that those of you who would like to get us a gift will try to think of gift giving in a different way for our wedding. Over the years a number of organizations and causes have become very prominent in both of our lives. It would mean a lot to us if you would consider giving a gift to one of these organizations in honor of our wedding. Believe us when we say that this would mean more to us than just about any wedding gift. More information on the specific organizations is coming soon.<br />

				For those attending a wedding shower and those that just can't help themselves, we have done registries at both Target and Bed, Bath, and Beyond.-->

						On our wedding day we celebrate the overflowing of our cup of blessings. On this day of
						abundance and thanksgiving, we invite you to consider celebrating our commitment to each other
						and our commitment to the world by giving generously to one of the following organizations.
						These are organizations that are significant to us as a couple. Giving to them would truly be
						the most meaningful way to honor our wedding day.<br /> <br /> <a
							href="http://www.htflive.org/index.cfm">Haitian Timoun Foundation</a> (HTF). The work of this
						organization supports children in Haiti, including the children who find their home in the St.
						Joseph Family - former street children, child slaves, and individuals with disabilities. In
						the summer of 2010, both of us had the opportunity to visit two of the St. Joseph family homes
						in Port-au-Prince and we continue to be blessed by the relationships that began on that trip.
						Haiti will always be close to our hearts.<br /> <br /> <a href="http://lincoln.nelcm.com/">The
							Lutheran Center</a> (NeLCM-Lincoln). A long, long time ago, Josh's parents found the Lutheran
						Center to be a church home while at college. They met there and fell in love. Now throughout
						our college years, The Lutheran Center has been a place to foster and strengthen our own
						relationship. We go to ask questions, to think deeply about God and the world, and to consider
						our vocations as disciples. The conversations and relationships that have developed in this
						place have been incredibly formational for our faith and for our love.<br /> <br /> <a
							href="http://www.clinicwithaheart.org/">Clinic With A Heart</a> is a free medical clinic
						serving the medically uninsured and underinsured populations of Lincoln. Erin currently
						volunteers at the clinic as Spanish-English translator and is passionate about the importance
						of the work that the clinic does.<br /> <br /> We have also registered for gifts at <a
							href="http://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/regGiftRegistry.asp?wrn=%2D1152946211&">Bed, Bath,
							and Beyond</a> and <a
