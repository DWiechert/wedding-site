		<!-- Our Story

			<h2>Our Story</h2>

			<p>One night during her freshman year in college, Shanna was studying with a friend, Connie,
				for a psychology exam she had later that week. They were studying in a room in Harper Hall where
				they both lived in the dorm rooms. Connie asked Shanna if she wanted to go hang out with these
				guys she met earlier that week, and like any college student, hanging out with guys sounded a
				lot more fun than studying! Connie and Shanna then went to floor eight where she met Dan, Greg
				and Travis. They hung out for a while and soon Dan asked Connie if Shanna was dating anyone. Dan
				found out that Shanna was single and soon asked for her number. Dan and Shanna would meet up for
				dinners at Harper Hall and would hang out whenever they had some free time. By the end of
				November of their freshman year, they were dating – and the rest is history!</p>

		<!-- Proposal
		 =================================================-->
		<section id="proposal">
			<h2>The Proposal</h2>

			<p>It was a Monday, and Dan and Shanna were visiting family in Chicago for his cousin Julie’s
				wedding that happened over the weekend. It was early in the morning when Dan’s sister Natalie
				came to ask Shanna if she would go to a park with her and her dog Roxie. Natalie had always said
				that Roxie needed daily walks and daily runs, so it was no surprise when Natalie asked this to
				Shanna. Shanna accepted, and then Natalie, Dan and her all hopped into Natalie’s car and drove
				to the park to let Roxie run.</p>
			<p>When they all arrived at the park, Shanna could tell that something was about to happen
				because Natalie started to say, “Oh look at these pretty flowers,” she was staying behind taking
				pictures, which Shanna thought was kind of weird. Dan then took Shanna to a peaceful spot and
				got down on one knee. Shanna doesn’t remember a single thing Dan said, but she knew that he was
				popping the question and of course, she said yes!</p>
			<p>After the proposal, it was filled with lots of family time and congratulations. There were
				a lot of visitors and a small gathering at the Wiecherts’ house. Then there was something
				totally unexpected that happened. For dinner, the family all went to one of the couple’s
				favorite restaurants in Dan’s hometown – Tai San – where the owner found out that they were all
				celebrating the couple’s engagement. The owner then went to the glass case and picked out a
				gorgeous vase from China to give to the couple. It was definitely a great ending to the perfect
				day.</p>
